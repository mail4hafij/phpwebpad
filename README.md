# phpwebpad
phpwebpad is a very lightweight MVC driven framework for web development. My idea was to build this framework for my personal use so that I have all the things that I need without the fancy complexities I find in other frameworks. I think, it is worth sharing this project. phpwebpad supports all the basic features that other PHP framewoks have (i.e., Routing actions based on regular expression, rendering elements, json actions, redirects, logging, actions authorizations, etc). It supports ORM (Object Releational Mapping) with MySql. The ORM has a lot of cool features. For example tables are created and altered on the fly, on code foreign key relationships, supports cascade delete, database transactions, etc. 

It gives all the basic things that you may expect from a server side MVC framework. You can learn it within an hour. Visit <a href="http://phpwebpad.hafij.com" target="_blank">phpwebpad.hafij.com</a>
