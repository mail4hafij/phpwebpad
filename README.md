# phpwebpad (including php 7.4 version)
phpwebpad is a very lightweight MVC driven framework for web development. My idea was to build this framework for my personal use so that I have all the things that I need without the fancy complexities I find in other frameworks. I think, it is worth sharing this project. 

phpwebpad supports all the basic features that other PHP framewoks have - 
  * MVC 
  * Routing actions based on regular expression
  * Action authorizations
  * JSON actions
  * Redirects
  * Action logging

It supports ORM (Object Releational Mapping) with MySql. The ORM has a lot of cool features - 
 * Tables are created and altered on the fly
 * On code foreign key relationships 
 * Cascade delete
 * Truncate tables without loosing auto increament index
 * Database transactions

It gives all the basic things that you may expect from a server side MVC framework. You can learn it within an hour. Visit <a href="http://phpwebpad.hafij.com" target="_blank">phpwebpad.hafij.com</a>
