# phpwebpad (updated to php version 8)
phpwebpad is a very lightweight MVC driven framework for web development. My idea was to build this framework for my personal use so that I have all the things that I need without the fancy complexities I find in other frameworks. I think, it is worth sharing this project. 

phpwebpad supports all the basic features that other PHP framewoks have - 
  * MVC 
  * Routing actions based on regular expression
  * Actions authorization
  * JSON actions
  * Redirects
  * Action logging

It supports ORM (Object Releational Mapping) with MySql. The ORM has a lot of cool features - 
 * Tables are created and altered on the fly
 * On code foreign key relationships 
 * Cascade delete
 * Truncate tables without loosing auto increament index
 * Database transactions

It is easily integratable with testing framworks such as <a href="https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/index.html" target="_blank">phpunit</a>

It gives all the basic features that you may expect from a server side MVC framework. You can learn it within an hour. Visit <a href="http://phpwebpad.hafij.com" target="_blank">phpwebpad.hafij.com</a>
